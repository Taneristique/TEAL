## Algorithms Study
This is a study for improving my coding skills, with an open source license.It contains different factors.These are psychology,math and sorting.

# Psychology 
guessnumber.py will give you an idea on the connection of human behaviors and luck games and how they can be easily manipulated.
I used ternary operators and recursive function in it.

# Math 
You will calculate factorielles,fibonacci numbers,and do some operations on matrix. Recursive functions and list comprehensions are used 

# Sorting
You will merge and bubble sort the given arrays to list them from lower values to highers. Recursive function is used in merge py
to divide given array by user.

## Requirements
    NUMPY  1.21.4
    PYTHON 3.9.11
